---

## Key Features & How They Work

### 1. Responsive Navigation Bar
- **What:** A top navigation bar with links to all main sections, social icons, a dark mode toggle, and a “Download Resume” button.
- **How:** Uses React-Bootstrap for layout and responsiveness. On mobile, it collapses into a hamburger menu for easy navigation.
- **Defend:** “I used Bootstrap’s NavBar for accessibility and mobile-friendliness, and customized it with React for dynamic features like dark mode and resume download.”

### 2. Banner (Hero) Section
- **What:** The landing section with a headline, animated typewriter effect, and a short intro.
- **How:** Uses React state and effects for the typewriter animation. The background changes based on the selected theme (image in dark mode, SVG wave in light mode).
- **Defend:** “I wanted the hero section to be visually engaging and theme-aware, so I used conditional rendering and CSS for dynamic backgrounds.”

### 3. Skills & Tech Stack
- **What:** Shows my main skills and technologies, grouped by category, with animated, interactive cards.
- **How:** Uses react-icons for logos and react-parallax-tilt for 3D card effects. Data-driven structure makes it easy to add or update skills.
- **Defend:** “Grouping skills by category and using animated cards makes my expertise clear and visually appealing. The 3D tilt effect adds interactivity.”

### 4. Projects Section
- **What:** Displays my projects with images, titles, and descriptions.
- **How:** Each project is a card; the section is fully responsive and can be extended with filtering or more interactivity.
- **Defend:** “I structured the projects section for easy scalability and to highlight my best work with clear visuals.”

### 5. Features Section
- **What:** Highlights my strengths (e.g., Responsive Design, Fast Performance) with icons and short descriptions.
- **How:** Uses a simple data array and react-icons for a clean, modern look.
- **Defend:** “This section quickly communicates my value to visitors and recruiters.”

### 6. Contact Section
- **What:** A contact form for visitors to reach me, plus social links.
- **How:** The form sends emails using a Node.js serverless function on Vercel, keeping my email private and secure.
- **Defend:** “Using a serverless function for the contact form means I don’t need a dedicated backend server, and my email is never exposed to the client.”

### 7. Footer
- **What:** Contains copyright and branding.
- **How:** Styled to match the rest of the site, with a background image and clear text.

## Advanced Enhancements

### Dark/Light Mode Toggle
- **What:** Users can switch between dark and light themes.
- **How:** Uses React state and CSS variables. All backgrounds, text, and cards respond to the selected theme.
- **Defend:** “Theme toggling improves accessibility and user comfort, and shows my attention to modern UI/UX trends.”

### Download Resume Button
- **What:** Prominently placed in the NavBar, links to my Google Drive resume.
- **How:** Opens the PDF in a new tab for easy access.
- **Defend:** “This makes it easy for recruiters to access my latest resume without extra clicks.”

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **What:** All sections and buttons are styled to fit and look good on mobile devices.
- **How:** Uses Bootstrap’s grid and custom media queries for fine-tuned control.
- **Defend:** “I tested and adjusted the layout for all screen sizes to ensure a professional experience everywhere.”

### Animated Tech Stack
- **What:** 3D tilt and fade-in effects on skill cards.
- **How:** react-parallax-tilt and AOS (Animate On Scroll) for smooth, modern animations.
- **Defend:** “Animations make the site feel alive and interactive, which helps it stand out.”

---

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Bootstrap, CSS (with custom variables for theming)
- **Icons:** react-icons
- **Animations:** react-parallax-tilt, AOS
- **Backend (Contact Form):** Node.js serverless function (Vercel)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (with GitHub integration for CI/CD)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## Deployment & Workflow
- All code is versioned with Git and pushed to GitHub.
- Vercel automatically deploys the latest version on every push.
- Environment variables (for email credentials) are securely managed in Vercel’s dashboard.

## How to Defend in an Interview
- **Why React?**  “React’s component-based architecture makes the site modular, maintainable, and scalable.”
- **Why serverless for contact?**  “Serverless functions are cost-effective, secure, and require no backend server management.”
- **How did you ensure responsiveness?**  “I used Bootstrap’s grid and custom media queries, and tested on multiple devices.”
- **How did you handle theming?**  “I used CSS variables and React state to allow instant theme switching across the whole site.”
- **How do you keep your resume up to date?**  “The resume button links to my Google Drive, so I can update my resume without redeploying the site.”
- **What was the biggest challenge?**  “Integrating serverless email and making the site fully theme-aware required careful state and CSS management.”
